We have been working on knee MR image analysis using deep learning and quantification algorithms. Our research topics include image segmentation, classification, quantification, and domain adaptation. Before I joined CLAIR, I was working on computational neuroscience associated with Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, depression,  and schizophrenia.

On-going Projects
------

- [**CartiMorph**](https://github.com/YongchengYAO/CartiMorph): This is an MR image analysis framework for automated knee articular cartilage morphometrics. We have trained models for image segmentation, registration, and template learning. Additionally, we have developed algorithms for robust cartilage thickness mapping, cartilage lesion quantification, cartilage parcellation, and other morphological measurements. We evaluated the performance of deep learning models not only in their specific tasks but also in downstream quantification tasks and gained insights into deep learning model performance. For example, achieving high segmentation accuracy in terms of the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) does not necessarily ensure accurate downstream tasks, such as cartilage lesion quantification. In summary, the framework takes a knee MR image as input and provides regional quantitative measurements as output.
- [**CartiMorph Toolbox**](https://github.com/YongchengYAO/CartiMorph-Toolbox): The software incorporates the **CartiMorph** framework and is enhanced with various valuable features, such as automatic computing environment configuration, model training, model fine-tuning, model inference, and visualisation.
