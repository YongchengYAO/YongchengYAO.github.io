We have worked on knee MR image analysis using deep learning and quantification algorithms. Our research topics include image segmentation, classification, quantification, and domain adaptation. Before I joined CLAIR, I was working on computational neuroscience associated with Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, depression,  and schizophrenia.
