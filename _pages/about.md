I am a doctoral researcher at the [UKRI CDT in Biomedical AI](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai), University of Edinburgh. Previously, I was a research assistant at the CU Lab of AI in Radiology ([CLAIR](http://www.diir.cuhk.edu.hk/research/medical-image-computing-and-artificial-intelligence/)), Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), where I worked with Prof. [Weitian Chen](http://www.diir.cuhk.edu.hk/profile/chen-weitian/). I obtained my M.Phil. in Imaging and Interventional Radiology from CUHK in 2020, and my B.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering from South China University of Technology in 2017. 

Research Interest

[**medical image analysis**, **deep learning**, **artificial intelligence**, **segmentation**, **registration**, **classification**, **model bias & fairness**, **data privacy**, **data imbalance**, **domain shift**]

My research interests lie in the intersection of medical image analysis and deep learning/artificial intelligence (DL/AI). Specifically, I am interested in using DL/AI for image segmentation, registration, and classification. In addition to exploring efficient model structures and training strategies, I believe the interpretability of deep learning models is an important research topic for biomedical AI. As such, I am also interested in model bias & fairness. 

In general, my passion lies not only in developing efficient algorithms to solve technical problems but also in bridging the gap between research and practical applications. I am interested in tackling various challenges in biomedical AI, including data privacy, data imbalance, and domain shift problems. In the coming years, I will focus on the intersection field of medical image analysis and deep learning, with a vision to improve clinical workflow via technical innovation.

Previously, I was working on computational neuroscience. Specifically, we analysed structural and functional brain MR images using morphometrics, statistical parametric mapping, connectivity analysis, graph-theory-based analysis, and machine learning.
