I am a research assistant at the CU Lab of AI in Radiology (CLAIR), The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I obtained my M.Phil. in Imaging and Interventional Radiology from CUHK in 2020, and my B.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering from South China University of China in 2017. 


Research Interest
------
My research interests lie in the intersection of **medical image analysis** and **deep learning/artificial intelligence (DL/AI)**. Specifically, I am interested in using DL/AI for **image segmentation**, **registration**, and **classification**. In addition to exploring efficient model structures and training strategies, I believe the interpretability of deep learning models is an important research topic for biomedical AI. As such, I am also interested in **model bias & fairness**. In general, my passion lies not only in developing efficient algorithms to solve technical problems but also in bridging the gap between research and practical applications. I am interested in tackling various challenges in biomedical AI, including **data privacy**, **data imbalance**, and **domain shift problems**. In the coming years, I will focus on the intersection field of medical image analysis and deep learning, with a vision to improve clinical workflow via technical innovation.

Previously, I was working on computational neuroscience. Specifically, we analysed structural and functional brain MR images using morphometrics, statistical parametric mapping, connectivity analysis, graph-theory-based analysis, and machine learning.
