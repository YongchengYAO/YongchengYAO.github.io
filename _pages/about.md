I am a PhD student, supervised by [Prof. Timothy Hospedales](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/),  at the [UKRI CDT in Biomedical AI](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai), School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh (UoE). Previously, I was a research assistant at the CU Lab of AI in Radiology (CLAIR), Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), where I worked with Prof. Weitian Chen. I obtained M.ScR in Biomedical Artificial Intelligence from UoE, M.Phil. in Imaging and Interventional Radiology from CUHK in 2020, and B.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering from the South China University of Technology in 2017.
